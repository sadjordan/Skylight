To be developed:
- Remove folder system for playlists [DONE]
- Function to add songs not currently in database [DONE]

- Database expansion (times listened, skipped, other metadata)
    - Need to use SQL insert to add them to my existing table [DONE]
    - Last listened to [DONE]
    - Utilize the newly added meta-data fields [IMPLEMENT-IN-FUTURE]

- Reimplement playlist system
    - Playlists should be stored as a single string in an entry in a db table [DONE]
    - Something like: Auto PK; playlist name; playlist song string [DONE]
    - String can be 1,4,5,6,7,8 according to the songs primary key in the all_songs table [DONE]
    - ~~The current playlist setting will be repurposed to store the name of the default playlist. To implement this, some user settings should be permanently saved in a db table.~~ Too much is relying on the DEFAULT_DIRECTORY variable to change now.
    - Base playlist with all songs, updated when new songs are added. [DONE]
    - Playlists must be able to be created, edited, deleted. [Delete Playlists]
    - Current system of switching playlists works, but must be adapted to the new db-based system. [DONE]
    - Display all playlists [DONE]
    - Prevent adding duplicates to playlist [DECIDED-NOT-TO-IMPLEMENT]
        - If people (ie, me) want to have songs appear multiple times in a playlist why not?

- Search feature expansion
    - Allow users to also use the number in the queue (dict) to use as queries [DONE]

Notes:
- Have to reform the way the player retrieves music upon start to use database referencing [DONE]

Known issues:
- Sometimes for songs with extensive names with parantheses (tell me im okay patrick) the name of the song is saved differently than the file name in the database.
