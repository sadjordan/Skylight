To be developed:
- Remove folder system for playlists [DONE]
- Function to add songs not currently in database [DONE]

- Database expansion (times listened, skipped, other metadata)
    - Need to use SQL insert to add them to my existing table
    - Last listened to


- Reimplement playlist system
    - Playlists should be stored as a single string in an entry in a db table
    - Something like: Auto PK; playlist name; playlist song string
    - String can be 1,4,5,6,7,8 according to the songs primary key in the all_songs table
    - The current playlist setting will be repurposed to store the name of the default playlist. To implement this, some user settings should be permanently saved in a db table.
    - Base playlist with all songs, updated when new songs are added.
    - Playlists must be able to be created, edited, deleted.
    - Current system of switching playlists works, but must be adapted to the new db-based system.

Notes:
- Have to reform the way the player retrieves music upon start to use database referencing
